# a Vim-like remote for Tivo, Plex Home Theatre, and Yamaha Receivers
## Not very user friendly unless you have the exact same setup as me:
### Yamaha RX-V473, Tivo Premeire, Plex Home Theatre
  - Change ips and ports in each module to match your network and equipment

## Things to do:
  - config file
  - Alfred 2 workflow, I'v never used it but from what I've seen it looks perfect for this 
  - fix some code smells
  - add ability to type in unmapped commands
## Usage
````ruby remote.rb````
press 'm' to select a control mode
press 'H' for help for that mode's commands
'q' to quit
