# a Vim-like remote for Tivo, Plex Home Theatre, and Yamaha Receivers
## Not very user friendly unless you have the exact same setup as me.
  - Change ips and ports in each module 

## Things to do:
  - config file
  - Alfred 2 workflow, I'v never used it but from what I've seen it looks perfect for this 
  - fix some code smells
  - add ability to type in unmapped commands
